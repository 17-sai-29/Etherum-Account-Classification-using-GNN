# Etherum-Account-Classification-using-GNN
Utilized graph-based visualizations to analyze the flow of Ethereum transactions,extracting node types and temporal features over defined time windows. Leveragedthese features as sequential inputs across timestamps and implemented graphneural networks (GNNs) to effectively predict node types and their behavioralpatterns.
